""" The Data module interacts with the Smartsheet API and the Jira Index
       Sheet. It is broken down into submodules for getting data from the
       Smartsheet API, building new data structures such as cells and rows,
       and writing data back to Smartsheets.

       The Helper submodule contains smaller functions to smooth the data
       transformation process between functions.
